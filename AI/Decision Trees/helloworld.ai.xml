	All profiles and trees work by calling accessing and compaing float variables
	-Variables are case sensity
	-Each Profile has it's own set of variables
	-In the event a profile has the same variable as a global var, the global var is prefered
	
	Avaliable Global Vars:
		-StageSize		<- The radius of the stage
		-AliveCount		<- How many other players are alive currently
		-ActionEnum		<- The current action being performed
			-0: None
			-1: Shooting
			-2: Shielding
		-ActionCooldown	<- How long until the current action is over
		
	Avaliable Actions:
		-Flee			<- Attempt to run away from nearby characters
		-Skirt			<- Attempt to stay as close to the edge as possible
		-Defend			<- Attempt to survive in the local area (Avoid moving)
		-Attack			<- Attempt to hunt down and kill others
		
	Supported Profile Vars:
